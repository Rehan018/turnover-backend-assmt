### 1. Application Architecture:

This eCommerce application follows a typical client-server architecture. Here's a brief overview:
- **Server Side**: This consists of the backend of your application, where the business logic, database interactions, and authentication are handled.

### 2. Technology Stack:

#### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Chosen for its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling asynchronous operations, such as handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility and scalability, allowing you to store data in JSON-like documents.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.


### 3. Database Design:

#### Collections/Tables:
1. **Users**: Stores information about users registered in the system.
   - Attributes: `_id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `verified`, `verificationCode`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

2. **Categories**: Represents product categories.
   - Attributes: `_id`, `name`, `description`, `user`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

3. **Products**: Stores information about products.
   - Attributes: `_id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `availability`, `quantity`, `category`, `user`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

                                                | updatedAt  |
                                                +------------+
```

### Summary:

Your eCommerce application utilizes a modern tech stack with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js (or equivalent frontend library). MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility and scalability, while Mongoose simplifies database interactions.

The database design consists of three main collections/tables: Users, Categories, and Products. Users store user information, Categories represent product categories, and Products contain details about the products offered in the application.

Overall, this architecture and database design provide a scalable and efficient solution for building an eCommerce application with robust user authentication, category management, and product listings.
